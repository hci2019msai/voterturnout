# Project Assignment #6

## Please open the index.html to start

## TASK
For this assignment, we want the user to complete their registration to vote. In doing this, the user must select that they are not registered to vote, input their information, read the reminders, and submit their relevant information. 

## COMPONENT
For this assignment, we have chosen to design and implement the following aspects of our prototype: a title containing links to the registration page -> the registration page -> reminders -> final submission.

## DESIGN SUMMARY
One of the main Norman Design Principles we kept in mind were affordances – how do our users perform the tasks they are given? Our main problem in our original testing was that users often did not know where to go once they saw our site. In designing our first prototype, we decided to make the path as simple as possible from the front page. After accessing the main page and going to ‘registration,’ the pathway from beginning to end is laid out in simple terms, with clearly marked ‘back’ and ‘next’ buttons prominently displayed. Our design has no other paths that the user can go down – it is simply a straight line from point A to point B to minimize confusion. 
Other design principle that we emphasized during the construction of this prototype were feedback – making sure that the user was aware that their information had been submitted (another problem encountered during initial user testing), visibility – making sure that all of the user’s options were present on the screen, and consistency – making sure that all of the same doors to the next part of the task were consistent and familiar to the users.
